Description: General framework to organize data, methods, and results used in
  reproducible scientific analyses. A TAF analysis consists of four scripts
  (data.R, model.R, output.R, report.R) that are run sequentially. Each script
  starts by reading files from a previous step and ends with writing out files
  for the next step. Convenience functions are provided to version control the
  required data and software, run analyses, clean residues from previous runs,
  manage files, manipulate tables, and produce figures. With a focus on
  stability and reproducible analyses, the TAF package comes with no
  dependencies. TAF forms a base layer for the 'icesTAF' package and other
  scientific applications.
